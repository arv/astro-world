    You've worked hard to figure out what factors mattered to the applicants' performance. Now, you can use your knowledge to predict how well they will do. I have some new applicants here. Can you predict how well they will do? Then you can choose a best team of five.<br>
    What information about the applicant would you need to predict his/her performance? I can only tell you up to four things about the applicant. Which factors do you want to know about? Look at the list of factors here; what information about them would you like to have?<br>
    You can refer to any of the charts anytime by clicking on the "Show Charts" button.<br>
