    Good job completing the memo! Now that you have figured out Fitness, let's go on to look at the rest.<br>
    How about we look at Parents' Health next? Why don't you try to figure out whether Parents' Health matter by choosing one or two cases.
    How many records would you like to see? One or Two?<br>

      <h3>Memo to the foundation</h3>
      <p>
        We recommend that you ask applicants about <u>Fitness</u> because <u>it makes a difference to how well applicants do.</u><br>
        <br>
        Our evidence for claiming this is:<br>
        <u><b>That we looked at case 6 and case 18 and everything is the same except for fitness. And Case 6 has a higher grade because fitness does matter.</b></u><br>
