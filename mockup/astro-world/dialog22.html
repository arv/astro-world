    So far our conclusions are all based on just two cases. We would be more sure of our conclusions if we looked at more cases. We have a way to do that.<br>
    You see, this chart here shows all of the applicants. Each diamond is the same as one record you saw before.<br>
    Do you see that they have different performance levels?<br>
    <br>    
    Student:<br>
    Yes<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Great. Now, let me show you one of the diamonds.<br>
    See here, record #2. What is the performance level of record #2?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    C<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    That's right. Just like all the cases you have looked at before. You can see the levels of this person's fitness, parents' health, and other factors.<br>
    What is the education level of this applicant?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Some college<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Good.<br>
    <br>
    Now, let's look at a different chart.<br>
    Here, we can change the chart so that we can see only some of the people.<br>
    <br>
    Can you tell me what level of fitness do all of these people have?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    They all have average fitness.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    That's right. So why do you think that even though all of these people have average fitness but they have different performance? Some have C and some have E. Why?
