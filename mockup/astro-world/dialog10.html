    Director:<br>
    You wanted to look at one record.<br>
    Which one would you like to see? Go ahead and select a level for each factor, and the computer will find you an applicant who is like that and tell you his/her performance<br>
    Click "OK" when you are ready.<br>
    <br>
    So, you want to look at record #5, Carolyn Lewis. Now, before I show you the performance. Can you tell me what you would be able to figure out by looking at this record?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    I will find out if Carolyn has good score.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Ok, now that you saw the performance. What did you find out?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    I found out that Carolyn does not have very good grade.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Do you have enough information to say whether fitness makes a difference to the performance in the space? Yes or No<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Yes<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Ok. Does fitness make a difference to the performance?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    I think it does.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    What will happen to the performance for this applicant if fitness was Excellent?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    She will get a higher grade.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Ok. Do you know for sure?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    No...<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Why don't you test it out? What record would you need?<br>
    To find the record, go ahead and select a level for each factor, and the computer will find you an applicant.<br>
    Remember to click "OK" when you are ready.<br>
    <br>
    Ok, you selected Record #2, Max Hernandez.<br>
    What did you find out?<br>
    Does fitness make a difference?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Yes! It makes a difference!<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    What makes you say that?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Because Max got a better grade than Carolyn and he has excellent fitness.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    That may be true. But can we really tell for sure that Max had a higher grade than Carolyn because he has excellent fitness? Couldnâ€™t someone say that it is because Max has college and that is why Max has a better grade than Carolyn? Do you really know for sure that fitness made the difference? Yes or No?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    No. I don't really know for sure.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Seems like we cannot be sure by comparing Carolyn and Max. Can we find a better comparison with Carolyn so that we can be 100% whether fitness matters?<br>
    What record would we need?<br>
    <br>
