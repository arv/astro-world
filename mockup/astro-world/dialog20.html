    So far our conclusions are all based on just two cases. We would be more sure of our conclusions if we looked at more cases. We have a way to do that.<br>
    You see, this chart here shows all of the applicants. Each diamond is the same as one record you saw before.<br>
    Do you see that they have different performance levels?<br>
    <br>    
    Student:<br>
    Yes<br>

    Great. Now, let me show you one of the diamonds.<br>
    See here, record #2. What is the performance level of record #2?<br>

    Director:<br>
    That's right. Just like all the cases you have looked at before. You can see the levels of this person's fitness, parents' health, and other factors.<br>
    What is the education level of this applicant?<br>
