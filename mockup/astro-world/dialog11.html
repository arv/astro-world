    Director:<br>
    You wanted to look at one record.<br>
    Which one would you like to see? Go ahead and select a level for each factor, and the computer will find you an applicant who is like that and tell you his/her performance<br>
    Click "OK" when you are ready.<br>
    <br>
    So, you want to look at record #18, Daisy Smith. Now, before I show you the performance. Can you tell me what you would be able to figure out by looking at this record?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    I will find out if Daisy has good score.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Ok, now that you saw the performance. What did you find out?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    I found out that Daisy does not have very good grade.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Do you have enough information to say whether fitness makes a difference to the performance in the space? Yes or No?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Yes<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Ok. Does fitness make a difference to the performance? Yes or No?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    I think it does.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    What will happen to the performance for this applicant if fitness was Excellent?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    She will get a higher grade.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Ok. Do you know for sure?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    No...<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Why don't you test it out? What record would you need?<br>
    To find the record, go ahead and select a level for each factor, and the computer will find you an applicant.<br>
    Remember to click "OK" when you are ready.<br>
    <br>
    Ok, you selected Record #4, Jane Lopez.<br>
    What did you find out?<br>
    Does fitness make a difference? Yes or No?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Yes! It makes a difference!<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    What makes you say that?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Because Jane got a better grade than Daisy and he has excellent fitness.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    That may be true. But can we really tell for sure that Jane had a higher grade than Daisy because he has excellent fitness? Couldn't someone say that it is because Jane has college and that is why Jane has a better grade than Daisy? Do you really know for sure that fitness made the difference? Yes or No?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    No. I don't really know for sure.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Seems like we cannot be sure by comparing Daisy and Jane. Can we find a better comparison with Daisy so that we can be 100% whether fitness matters?<br>
    What record would we need?<br>
    <br>
    Ok, you selected Record #6, Natasha O'Connor.<br>
    What did you find out?<br>
    Does fitness make a difference? Yes or No?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Yes! It makes a difference!<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    What makes you say that?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Because Natasha got a better grade than Daisy and he has excellent fitness.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    But does it have to be fitness that is making the difference? Could I say that Natasha has a better grade than Daisy because he has excellent for parents' health?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    No, because they have the same parents' health<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    I see! Ok. Now, Suppose someone disagrees with you and doesn't think that fitness makes a difference. What would you say to them to convince them?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    I would say that it really matters because everything is the same but Daisy has a lower grade because she has average fitness.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Ok, great, so you are sure then?<br>
