    OK. You wanted to look at two records.<br>
    Which ones would you like to see? For each record, go ahead and select a level for each factor, and the computer will find you an applicant who is like that and tell you his/her performance<br>
    Click "OK" when you are ready.<br>
    So, you want to look at record #4, Jane Lopez and #10, David Foster. Now, before I show you the performances. Can you tell me what you would be able to figure out by looking at these records?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    I will find out if parents health matters.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    Ok, now that you saw the performances. What did you find out?
    Does Parents' Health make a difference? Yes or No?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Yes! It really does!<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    What makes you say that?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    Because Jane got a better grade than David and she has excellent parents health.<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    But does it have to be Parents' Health that is making the difference? Could I say that Jane has a better grade than David because he has excellent for Fitness?<br>
    <br>
    Student:<br>
    No, because they have the same fitness<br>
    <br>
    Director:<br>
    I see! Ok. Now, what if I change your comparison so that instead of David, I compare Jane with Mathew like I show you here. Would I still be able to tell if Parents' Health make a difference?<br>
    <br>
